So today I remembered about sin. 
It was a long-long time before this happened, but yeah, I am really excited about me coding again.
I learned a lot, I saw things and I've come with many refactorings to do.
As soon as I took a look on the code I fixed the bug that drove me mad back then (when I gave up on commiting things).
As a part of fixing it I introduced new abstract method isClient() to AbstractGameObject with final realizations in Server and Client Game Objects. 
This will help to get rid of terribly looking infinite 'instances f's and will aid the code's health.
As well I took a look on my devlist and considered it may take some reorganizations. First of all, there certainly should be an issue number near each line to relate.
Secondly, there may be a need to do something about those '+'s and '-'s, what I'm of no aware at the moment. Thirdly, I beleive structural changes, new features and improvements should be separeted.
I also commented lines that I wondered about even a little while reading through the code .
Back then (Jule 2014) I decided to go for 0.1 milestone asap, but now I feel more like taking a grasp on things and seeing what can be done to make the code look more healthy, as there are some bad-coded things which I do not like.

This evening I walked a little bit around my district and brought up all the memories form more than half of year ago. Ah, sweet old nostalgia.

Ha!
Today I did a big amount of work towards SIN and I honestly do hope it is not the end of my enthusiasm.
Jeez, I even forgot where I took off.
I managed to find what I was doing and redid all of the starting system. I'm truly a genius.

Moved all of the keyboard code to the separate class. It is not working for now though, but I really like the way it is moving to.
I think most of the reworking is done already and nowis time to finally fix the thing, haha.
